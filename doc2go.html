    <h3> Inspiration </h3>
      <p> We empathized with patients that live in rural areas where accessing healthcare was an additional
      burden on top of their medical needs. Through viewing the problem from the perspective of our user
      persona, we were able to understand their pain points, what matters more to them, and what
      good healthcare looked like for them.
      </p>
    <h3> What it does </h3>
      <p> Our solution aims to seamlessly bridge the gap between the medical consultation and the patient
        getting their requested investigative tests done. We created a business model where postconsultation,
        the doctor can request e.g. blood test, ECG, urine sample etc through our booking
        system, and then this would be accessible to the patient to book, via our app Doc2Go, at a time
        and date that is most convenient for them... and at their home! Not only does this provide value
        for the patient, but also the healthcare workers, the insurance companies, and the larger
        healthcare governing bodies.
      </p>
    <h3> How we built it </h3>
      <p> We built the wireframe and prototype using Figma and built the demo app using Voiceflow
      coding technology (which runs off the back of JavaScript)
      </p>
    <h3> Challenges we ran into </h3>
      <p> Creating an API on Voiceflow that would not only call on data stored in a database (that held the
        patient's medical test requests) but making it also push data to a Google calendar and to a second
        separate database once the request had been booked. Also getting a screen record of the voice
        flow demo (we have linked the prototype down below instead - have fun using it!)
      </p>
    <h3> Accomplishments that we're proud of </h3>
      <p> We're really proud of what we created to meet an important user need, and the fact that this
      project was created over a weekend, with us being hackathon newbie's, and we've never worked
      together before, made it all the better as we worked really well together, leaning on each other's
      strengths and collaborating across different geographical timezones!
      </p>
    <h3> What we learned </h3>
      <p> The power of communication (so regular zoom catch-ups to update on progress and next tasks)
        and project managing to stay on track.
